# Spellfrog Simple 2D Engine

## I've moved on from this project and it is archived!

This is a simple 2D engine sandbox project that I'm making to become more comfortable with c++ and SDL2.

## TODO:
* [X] GameManager Init and Update
* [X] Input Event class (no more spaghetti code)
* [X] Physics function for basic gravity ...
* [ ] Rendering geometry instead of textures
* [ ] Drawing squares(?)
* [ ] Collision detection
* [ ] Add frame cap (no more computer dying)
